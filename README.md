•	The primary key of the OrdLine table is a combination of OrdNo and ProdNo. 
•	The Employee table has a self-referencing (unary) relationship to itself through the foreign key, SupEmpNo, the employee number of the supervising employee. In the     relationship diagram, the table Employee_1 is a representation of the self-referencing relationship, not a real table.
